# Video Watermarking

The "Video Watermarking" notebook implements an easy-to-use script for video watermarking.
It decomposes the input video into frames, applies a DWT-DCT transform and embeds a watermark in the wavelet domain.
Then, the script extracts the watermark to make sure of the embedding quality and robustness.

More informations coming soon.
